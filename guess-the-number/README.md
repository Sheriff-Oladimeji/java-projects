# Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²  

A simple Java console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.  

## How It Works  
1. The computer generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1-100).  
2. The player inputs a guess.  
3. The game provides feedback:  
   - "Too high!" if the guess is too high.  
   - "Too low!" if the guess is too low.  
   - "Correct!" if the guess is right.  
4. The game keeps running until the correct number is guessed.  
5. Optionally, the player can choose to play again.  

## What You'll Learn  
- **Basic Java syntax** (variables, loops, conditionals).  
- **Random number generation** (`Math.random()` or `Random`).  
- **User input handling** (`Scanner`).  
- **Loops and conditionals** (`while`, `if-else`).  

## Features to Add (Optional)  
- **Difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
- **Attempts counter** to track guesses.  
- **Replay option** after winning.  

## Next Steps  
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.  
- Implement a GUI version using **Java Swing/JavaFX**.  

Happy coding! ðŸš€
