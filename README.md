# Java Console Projects

A collection of Java console applications designed to strengthen programming skills through real-world projects. Each project progressively introduces core Java concepts, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming and file handling.

---

## **1. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** (Beginner)

A simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player competes against the computer.

**Features:**
- Randomized computer choices.
- User input validation.
- Basic game logic with conditional statements.

---

## **2. Number Guessing Game** (Beginner)

The program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it with hints like “higher” or “lower.”

**Features:**
- Random number generation.
- Looping until the correct guess.
- User input validation.
- Replay option.

---

## **3. To-Do List Console App** (Intermediate)

A simple command-line to-do list where users can add, remove, and view tasks.

**Features:**
- Dynamic list management using ArrayLists.
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
- Persistent loop for task management.

---

## **4. Bank Account Management System** (Intermediate)

A console-based system where users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.

**Features:**
- Object-oriented design with classes and encapsulation.
- Error handling for invalid transactions.
- Secure data access through encapsulated fields.
- Real-time balance updates.

---

## **5. Library Management System** (Advanced)

A system to manage books in a library, allowing users to add books, borrow, return, and view available books.

**Features:**
- Advanced OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces).
- Efficient data management using HashMap or HashSet.
- File I/O for data persistence.
- Error handling for file operations and user inputs.
