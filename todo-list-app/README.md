# **Guide to Building a To-Do List Console App in Java**

## **1. Project Overview**
A simple command-line to-do list application where users can add, remove, and view tasks.

## **2. Tools and Technologies**
- Programming Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
- Command Line/Terminal for execution

## **3. Features and Functionality**
- **Add Tasks**: Users can input a task to be added to the list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks with their respective indices.
- **Remove Tasks**: Allow users to remove a task by specifying its index.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Optionally allow marking tasks as done.
- **Exit Program**: Provide an option to exit the app gracefully.

## **4. Steps to Build the Application**

### **Step 1: Plan the Data Structure**
- Use an **ArrayList** in Java to store tasks.
- Each task can be a simple string or an object with a description and a completion status.

### **Step 2: Implement Basic CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: Implement a method to add tasks.
- **Read**: Implement a method to display all tasks.
- **Update (Optional)**: Implement a method to mark a task as completed.
- **Delete**: Implement a method to remove tasks.

### **Step 3: Set Up the User Interface (CLI)**
- Use a **loop** to continuously prompt the user for actions.
- Provide a menu with options (e.g., "1. Add Task", "2. View Tasks", "3. Remove Task", "4. Exit").
- Capture and process user input with appropriate error handling.

### **Step 4: Implement Input Handling**
- Use a **Scanner** in Java to take user input.
- Ensure that invalid inputs (e.g., selecting an out-of-range index) are handled gracefully.

### **Step 5: Implement a Loop for Continuous Execution**
- Keep the program running until the user selects "Exit".
- Use a `while` or `do-while` loop to maintain the menu system.

### **Step 6: Test the Application**
- Add multiple tasks and ensure they are stored correctly.
- Remove tasks and verify that they are deleted properly.
- Handle edge cases like empty lists, invalid inputs, and duplicate tasks.

### **Step 7: (Optional) Enhance with Additional Features**
- Save tasks to a **file** so they persist after the program exits.
- Allow users to **edit** existing tasks.
- Implement **task categories** for better organization.

## **5. Deployment and Usage**
- Compile and run the program using:
  - `javac TodoList.java`
  - `java TodoList`
- Share the script with others or upload it to GitHub.

## **6. Summary**
By following this guide, you will learn how to handle **ArrayLists**, implement **CRUD operations**, use **loops**, and structure a simple console application efficiently. Happy coding!
